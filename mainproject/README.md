My app is an artist portfolio helper that helps artists upload their photos to one platform, organize it and helps make it easier to find in a consolidated place for the artist.
There is also a reddit feature that allows the user to search subreddits for inspiration regarding their next project which could be expanded to pull images from other social media or official sources
In the future when given more time I would like to enhance the photo upload feature so that multiple photos can be seen at once
I would also like to create an API for Instagram and Facebook as other resources to share and pull information for the artist.
Also, a feature to generate custom artistic resumes with the artists portfolio is an ultimate goal as well.
